A no-good, very bad, horrid sysconf. It works on my machine so hope you have fun as well

make sure to import you hardware config
```bash
sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix ./nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
sudo chown $USER ./nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
```

You can now build just like this:
```bash
./build all 
```
